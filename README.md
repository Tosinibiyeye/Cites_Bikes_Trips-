# Cites_Bikes_Trips-

 ## Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of bikeshare usage in Chicago, Illinois, using data from Divvy, a major public bicycle-sharing system in the city. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from bikeshare usage patterns to help optimize operations, improve service, and support data-driven decisions for the city's transportation system.

 ## About the American Transport Provider
In Chicago, Divvy operates as the city's primary bikeshare system. Divvy is part of a larger effort by the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) to provide sustainable and affordable transit solutions. The system allows residents and tourists to rent bicycles from docking stations located throughout the city.

 ## Key features of Divvy:

Dock-based bike-sharing system: Users can rent bikes from any station and return them to any other station.
Flexible access: Divvy offers annual memberships, daily passes, and single rides.
Coverage: Hundreds of stations are spread across neighborhoods, covering both downtown and suburban areas of Chicago.
## Data Source (Bikeshare Data)
The analysis leverages public bikeshare trip data provided by Divvy. This data includes millions of bike rides taken by users and is freely available through open data platforms such as Chicago's Open Data Portal.

## The dataset typically includes:

- Trip start and end times: Information about when and where each trip began and ended.
- Station locations: GPS coordinates of the docking stations.
- Bike ID: Unique identifiers for the bikes.
- User type: Whether the rider is a subscriber (annual member) or a casual rider (one-time user).
- Trip duration: The total time of each trip.
- 
 ## Purpose of Analysis
The primary objective is to analyze Divvy bikeshare data to understand key metrics such as:

- Peak usage times: Identify when bikes are most and least used.
- Popular routes: Find the most frequently traveled routes between stations.
- User behavior: Examine the differences between casual users and subscribers.
- Geographical trends: Understand bike demand in different areas of Chicago.
  
 ## Tools and Libraries Used
The analysis is conducted using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment, and key Python libraries include:

- pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
- geopandas: For spatial analysis and mapping.
- NumPy: For handling numerical computations.
- 

 ## Expected Outcomes
This analysis is expected to provide insights into:

- Optimizing bikeshare station locations based on usage patterns.
- Reducing bike shortages at high-demand stations.
- Supporting sustainability goals by promoting bikeshare usage across Chicago.
